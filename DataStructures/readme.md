## Collections

1. `List`(when sequence matters) : collection that knows about `index position`. List knows where something is in the list.
2. `SET` (when uniqueness matters) : Collections that do not allow the duplicates. It's impossible to have something referencing  the same object
3. `MAP` (When finding something by key matters) : Collections that use key-value pairs. Maps know the value associated with a given key. No duplicate in keys.
